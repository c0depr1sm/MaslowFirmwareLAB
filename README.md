# Maslow Firmware

This is my version of the firmware which controls the Maslow CNC machine.

I renamed a few things, and I'm working out a parametric model to address sources of positioning errors.

Hopefully, when the optical measurement work will yield accurate error measurements, 
we'll have a parametric model ready for tune up.

For any questions abut the generic Malsow cnc, reach for the main maslow cnc github :-)
